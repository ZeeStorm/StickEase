StickEase
=========

StickEase was a simple project that was going to bring the agile sticky board interface to the web.. and as simple as it should be. Most online agile management systems are all complex, when in reality, many teams just need draggable sticky notes.

Since this was going to be a SaaS, there is a half-finished user system in this. I'm open sourcing this since I no longer feel that I'll finish it, and it's still pretty fun to play with. It's a good demonstratipn of my basic coding abilities (even if it's over a year old), and what I was capable of building in a few short days.

StickEase was built with PHP 5 + CodeIgniter, jQuery 1.6.4, handlebars and misc jQuery plugins. It also includes a self built rudimentary CodeIgniter API system that was developed for the original Stage (http://stage.io) concept. It has evolved many times over since this, but was a great experiment.

Enjoy :)
